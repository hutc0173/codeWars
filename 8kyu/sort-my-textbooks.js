// HELP! Jason can't find his textbook! It is two days before the test date, and Jason's textbooks are all out of order! Help him sort a list (ArrayList in java) full of textbooks by subject, so he can study before the test.

// The sorting should NOT be case sensitive

function sorter(textbooks) {
  return textbooks.sort((a, b) => {
    let lowerA = a.toLowerCase();
    let lowerB = b.toLowerCase();

    if (lowerA < lowerB) {
      return -1;
    }
    if (lowerA > lowerB) {
      return 1;
    }
    return 0;
  });
}
